//! FrankenTUI-compatible TUI initialization
//!
//! This module provides the bridge between jcode's terminal initialization
//! and the frankentui runtime.
//!
//! ## How it works with frankentui
//!
//! Frankentui's `AppBuilder::run()` manages terminal setup internally via the
//! CrosstermEventSource, which handles:
//! - Entering alternate screen mode
//! - Enabling mouse capture
//! - Enabling focus change events
//! - Kitty keyboard enhancement
//!
//! However, we still need to track the state for cleanup and maintain
//! compatibility with jcode's cleanup_tui_runtime pattern.
//!
//! For phase 1.3, the initialization is simplified because frankentui handles
//! most terminal setup internally.
