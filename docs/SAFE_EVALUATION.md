# Safe evaluation profile

A first-run "kick the tires" profile for evaluating jcode safely **before** pointing it at your main machine, primary credentials, or sensitive repositories.

## Quick start

```bash
jcode --safe-eval run "say hello"
```

That's it. The flag layers a conservative sandbox on top of whatever else you pass.

Equivalent without the flag:

```bash
JCODE_SAFE_EVAL=1 jcode run "say hello"
```

## What `--safe-eval` actually does

`--safe-eval` (and the matching `JCODE_SAFE_EVAL=1` env var) is translated at startup into a coordinated set of environment overrides:

| Env var set | Effect |
|---|---|
| `JCODE_HOME=~/.jcode-safe-eval/` (only if `JCODE_HOME` was not already set) | Isolated config / sessions / memory / auth dir. Your real `~/.jcode/` is **not** touched, read, or written. |
| `JCODE_OFFLINE=1` | Disables all startup network operations (update check, telemetry, provider model-list refresh). Provider API calls during a session are unaffected. |
| `JCODE_NO_TELEMETRY=1` | Belt-and-suspenders: even if telemetry was somehow re-enabled, no events are sent. |
| `JCODE_AMBIENT_DISABLED=1` | Ambient mode does not start a background runner. |
| `JCODE_NO_SELFDEV=1` | Self-dev auto-detection is suppressed. |
| `JCODE_REQUIRE_MCP_TRUST=1` | Project-local `.jcode/mcp.json` / `.claude/mcp.json` are skipped unless their content is in the user's trust store. Manage with `jcode mcp trust <path>` / `jcode mcp revoke <path>` / `jcode mcp list`. See issue #62. |

A short banner is printed at startup so you can confirm the profile took effect:

```
Safe-eval profile: isolated JCODE_HOME, telemetry off, offline, ambient/selfdev gated.
  JCODE_HOME = /home/<user>/.jcode-safe-eval
```

(Pass `--quiet` to suppress the banner once you're comfortable with what it does.)

## What is **not** disabled

- The provider you choose still talks to its API during the session itself. `--safe-eval` is about jcode's startup behavior + persistent state, not about cutting off the LLM call you actually came to make.
- Built-in tools (`read`, `write`, `edit`, `bash`, …) are unchanged. You still have a powerful agent — just aimed at a sandboxed home dir.
- MCP servers from `~/.jcode-safe-eval/mcp.json` (if you create one inside the isolated home) still run. The isolated home means you won't accidentally pick up MCP configs from your real `~/.jcode/`.

## Recommended workflow for first-run evaluation

1. **Use a disposable repo / worktree.** `cd ~/sandbox && git clone --depth 1 …`.
2. **Run jcode under `--safe-eval`** so nothing from your real `~/.jcode/` is read or written.
3. **Pass an explicit cheap provider.** For instance:
   ```bash
   jcode --safe-eval --provider deepseek run "explain this repo"
   ```
4. **Verify the isolation.** After the run:
   ```bash
   ls ~/.jcode-safe-eval         # session, auth, memory all live here
   diff -r ~/.jcode ~/.jcode-safe-eval 2>/dev/null | head
   ```
   Your real `~/.jcode/` should be unchanged.
5. **When happy, drop the flag and use jcode normally.**

## Cleanup

```bash
rm -rf ~/.jcode-safe-eval
```

That removes every artifact `--safe-eval` produced — sessions, auth tokens stored in the isolated home, transcripts, memory, etc.

## Compose with other flags

`--safe-eval` is layered, so all other flags still work and override or extend the defaults:

```bash
# Want telemetry on for a one-off in safe-eval mode?
JCODE_NO_TELEMETRY=0 jcode --safe-eval run "..."

# Want a different isolated home?
JCODE_HOME=/tmp/jcode-test jcode --safe-eval run "..."
```
